# blog-comment-section

This repository powers the comment section for [my blog](blog.chappell.nyc). I'm using [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) to leverage GitHub Discussions as a platform for blog comments. Each discussion corresponds to a blog post and the comments on that issue represent the comments for the post.

## How It Works:

Blog Integration: The blog is set up to integrate with Giscus, and each post corresponds to a GitHub discussion in this repository. When a new blog post is published, a new discussion will be automatically created here.

## Leaving a Comment: 

To leave a comment, simply use the comment form at the bottom of the blog post. You'll be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account. After authentication, your comment will appear as a comment on the corresponding GitHub discussion in this repo.

## Moderation: 

I actively monitor and moderate comments to ensure a respectful and constructive conversation.
